# Prediction-teeth-age
- In this project we will present the prediction of the age of an individual based on the dental maturity and sex. 

- This project responds to the application of the knowledge acquired in the Marchine Learning course. That is why we will see the different stages of a practical exercise of prediction of continuous or discrete variables.

- The dataset we use contains 9 parameters, we will firstly observe the attributs of the parameters and do data cleansing, then apply regression models on these parameters to predict the age since the variable age is a continuous variable.

- Among the many algorithms, we chose Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support-vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron and Extreme Gradient Boosting due to their stable performance. At last, we will find the best model and the best hyper parameters to predict the age of the patients. In addition, strategies for feature selection were used to reduce the dimension of prediction.
